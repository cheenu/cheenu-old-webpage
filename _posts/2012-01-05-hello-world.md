So I wanted to create a blog. The immediate options were Wordpress, Tumblr and Posterous. I created an account on all three of these providers, but none of them felt right. They are not minimalist enough, the default layout and the themes available in customization have too much clutter. I don't like editing HTML and CSS in a &lt;textarea&gt; either (or copying it over which more often than not messes up the formating). 

After some further ~~research~~ googling which included the tempting option of reinventing the wheel for the 103534th time by writing my own blogging app in rails, I settled on github and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It just feels better creating a new post with a git push instead of clicking on 'Publish'. It just feels better using Markdown for styling instead of pressing Ctrl+B twice. Oh, and it just feels better typing all this on vim instead of some &lt;textarea&gt;.

I recommend you to check out [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). They call it a 'blog aware static site generator' which I think is an apt description. I like to look at it as a hacker-friendly blogging platform without the bloat.
