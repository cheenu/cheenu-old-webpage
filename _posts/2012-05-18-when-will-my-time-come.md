It is easy to feel a sense of dejection when you read the mainstream news. You read about another guy who's going to be a billionaire before 30, you read about how he was making money at 14 years of age and other towering achievements that mock your resume.

You look back on all the years of high school drinking and college drinking and all the drinking in between and wonder what would have been if you had been more productive and spent less time hanging out with friends doing nothing at all. 

The quote below is from Phil Galfond, one of the sickiest poker players ever. He's on the other side of us and thinks that the grass is greener on our side. Just like we all think the grass on his side is greener. 

>_So, I dropped out of school to play poker.  Would I do it again? Do I regret it?_

>_The truth is, I do regret dropping out, and actually, I regret getting so serious about poker so early on.  I don’t mind the fact that I don’t have a degree (what’s a Philosophy degree worth anyways?), but I mind that I missed out on being a college student.  I missed out on some of my youth._

>_Sure, I was still hanging out with friends, some of whom were students, but it wasn’t the same.  I had other focuses, responsibilities.  I had job offers from training sites, accountants to hire, bankroll decisions to make.  I grew up too quickly._

>_I wish I would have stayed in school and played a little bit of poker on the side, but not so much that it almost consumed my life like it did._

>_**You can always go back to school and get a degree, yeah, but you can’t go back and be 21 again.**_

Happiness is deciding the grass that you're standing on is the greenest. Not green enough for you to settle but the greenest for miles. It is a choice.
